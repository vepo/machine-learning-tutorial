# Machine Learning Tutorial

This is a simple tutorial of how create a Tensorflow model and how to use this model in a application.

## What is Tensorflow

Tensor is a Google framework that helps you add Machine Learning to your application.

## How Machine Learning works

Machines will never learning anything. 

Machine only recognizes patterns.

So the first step for using a Machine Learning approaches is teach the machine to recognizes a pattern. This means you should train the machine and creates a model.

## Creating the trainning environment

The first step for using Tensorflow is create the trainning environment. 

You can see at [Dockerfile](prepare-train/Dockerfile) who you can setup the environment for trainging and prepare the data.
